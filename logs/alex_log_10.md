### Log for 2021-06-15

> **Goals for today:** Revise/finish scene functionality and cellular automata logic, and make progress on free play

> **Accomplished:** Finally, fully finished the scene and mode switching, and got further in implementing the free play mode

> **Plans for next day:** Finish the free play, menu, and target modes (which includes elements like the buttons and target system)

> **Problems/bugs noted:** (nothing that hasn't already been fixed or isn't in obvious early development)

> **Other notes:** A common theme in this project has been me spending far more days than anticipated on one thing. First it was the UML, now it's the scene switching functionality. Of course I'm happy with how both of those turned out now that it's over, but it took way too long to get them there. If I spend tomorrow making as much as I can in terms of actual game modes, and Thursday polishing and adding all the documentation, I'll do fine in terms of timing

## TEMPLATE ENDS HERE. MEETINGS START HERE.
