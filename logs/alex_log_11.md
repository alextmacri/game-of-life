### Log for 2021-06-16

> **Goals for today:** Make the button UI element, and finish a basic version of the main menu and free play mode (sadly, target mode just isn't a practical goal anymore for my deadline)

> **Accomplished:** FINALLY, finished a (very) basic version of the main menu and free play mode (which also meant making teh button UI element)

> **Plans for next day:** Polish off what I have, and make it presentable. This means: adding the pause panel, finishing my in-code documentation, cleaning up my logs and readme, making my report, adding the menu title, adding the backdrop, and adding sound FX. And when I get bored, I will "test out the free play mode"

> **Problems/bugs noted:** - (as you can tell by now, I don't like ending off nights with known bugs lingering)

> **Other notes:** Even though I now know I can't get target mode done by Friday, it was still extremely satisfying to see everything (and I say "everything" very lightly) come together today. I've become quite the fan of Conway's Game of Life while researching for this project and working on it, and, though you may think I'm biased, my version was a lot easier to use than the ones online. It may not have speed controls, but I'm (probably) gonna work on automatic dynamic speed (which is even better), and it may not be an infinite world, but that's not totally a bad thing (it creates new outcomes to explore. For instance, gliders turn into 2x2 static blocks when they hit the wall. That's pretty cool, I wonder what people could do with that)

## TEMPLATE ENDS HERE. MEETINGS START HERE.
