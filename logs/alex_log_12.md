### Log for 2021-06-17

> **Goals for today:** Add the pause panel, finish the in-code documentation, clean up the logs and readme, add the menu title, 

> **Accomplished:** Small fixes of previously unknown bugs, and added some more buttons/features (forward and reset), and automtic stopping. Also, you can't click any button except for stop when you are actively playing. I got busy with the math exam and other assignments before I could move on to any of the actual things I wanted to do today

> **Plans for next day:** Do what I actually wanted to do today. This means: adding the pause panel, finishing my in-code documentation, cleaning up my logs and readme, making my report, adding the menu title, and adding sound FX. In that order. If I get done all that, I'll really click around and look for some bugs

> **Problems/bugs noted:** - (as you can tell by now, I don't like ending off nights with known bugs lingering)

> **Other notes:** I'll be fine if I don't completely get all of those things done, I definitely want to

## TEMPLATE ENDS HERE. MEETINGS START HERE.
