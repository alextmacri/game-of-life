### Log for 2021-06-19

> **Goals for today:** Add the pause panel, finish the in-code documentation, clean up the logs and readme, add the menu title, and do any other bug fixes if I run into any

> **Accomplished:** Everything I wanted to: I added the pause panel and main menu title, and I cleaned up the in-code documentation, daily logs, and readme

> **Plans for next day:** Today's the last day that I'm formally working on this project as a school project, but as the summer goes on I'll keep going with it until my origina plan for it is realized. Even though I'll still use github, I won't be making any more of these logs. Sure, it is pretty fun looking back at all of them, and how I constantly fell further back behind schedule, but I just don't believe it's a practical thing to do as a part of a hobby passtime, at least for me

> **Problems/bugs noted:** Again, none, and I'm pretty confident in this, because I do a good amount of testing for all the different cases when I think of after I code in a new feature. The only reason one of them went under the radar (the one I fixed last time) was because that error is very hard to run into with pyglet's slow mouse position updates (and even then, it was a very minor error that seemingly doesn't effect the window itself)

> **Other notes:** Even though I didn't get all the modes I wanted to done, I'm pretty satisfied with the work I did here. I made all the infrastructure for something I'll definitely keep working at as summer starts. Being able to switch modes and scenes, and even bring up smaller sub-windows/panels in those scenes, all in pyglet, was pretty cool, and excited to find out what I have to come up with next. I'm also considering going further with this infrastructure stuff I did, and making a small "game engine" based off pyglet (or, at least turning the scene and mode switching into some sort of pakcage after some revisions)

## TEMPLATE ENDS HERE. MEETINGS START HERE.
