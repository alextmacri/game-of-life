### Log for 2021-06-05

> **Goals for today:** Finish UML diagrams and start making the free play mode

> **Accomplished:** Made some progress on UML diagrams

> **Plans for next day:** Finish UML, and maybe start the free play mode

> **Problems/bugs noted:** -

> **Other notes:** I guess I heavily underestimated how long it'd take to learn about UML, then actually plan out the whole project in that foramt. Even though I'll start out the week off schedule, I'm not too worried, since it'll be all but guarunteed smooth sailing from here, due to this planning

## TEMPLATE ENDS HERE. MEETINGS START HERE.
