### Log for 2021-06-09

> **Goals for today:** Make UML revisions and continue making free play mode

> **Accomplished:** Made most of my UML revisions and continued making free play mode

> **Plans for next day:** Finish UML once and for all, and get a lot (if not all) of free play mode done

> **Problems/bugs noted:** -

> **Other notes:** I forgot to do these for the past couple days. Today and yesterday I worked on essentially the same stuff, with more of a focus on the free play mode than the UML yesterday, so this can almost act as a log for both days

## TEMPLATE ENDS HERE. MEETINGS START HERE.
