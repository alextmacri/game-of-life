### Log for 2021-06-10

> **Goals for today:** Finish UML and Gantt and planning revisions, and make the mode and scene functionality

> **Accomplished:** Finished UML and Gantt planning and revisions, and made the mode and scene functionality

> **Plans for next day:** Finish (or at least make progress on) implementation of Free play

> **Problems/bugs noted:** -

> **Other notes:** Since I'm conceptually done the free play mode (I've done a few tests, thought things through, and wrote down what the logic will be), I'm moving on to the basis of the "mini engine" I'm making for this game. The whole GameWindow -> Mode -> Scene architecture would be a good idea to build earlier on rather than later, since I've made it so easy to add and connect more things as I build

## TEMPLATE ENDS HERE. MEETINGS START HERE.
