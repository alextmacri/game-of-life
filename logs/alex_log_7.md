### Log for 2021-06-10

> **Goals for today:** Continue with scene functionality and free play

> **Accomplished:** Made good progress on scene switching and free play

> **Plans for next day:** Finish free play and scene switching

> **Problems/bugs noted:** I can't upscale a loaded image in pyglet (it graphically "glitches" if it shows up at all), but I can downscale it. Won't be doing that, though, since my original purpose for resizing was to have smaller file sizes with lower resolution assets that I could just stretch out in-game, but I guess I can't do that

> **Other notes:** I didn't make one yesterday because I planed on making one today, and I knew that at least one of these two days I didn't need to make one, so I thought this would be fine. I also spent more time yesterday on the research assignment, so not as much got done here

## TEMPLATE ENDS HERE. MEETINGS START HERE.
