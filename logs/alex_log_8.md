### Log for 2021-06-14

> **Goals for today:** Finish scene functionality and free play

> **Accomplished:** Arguably finished the scene functionality, and made some good progress on free play (I made ways to create and display the universe (with SOME reaction to mouse presses), and worked on the logic a bit in another python file that I will inevitably delete once I implement its ideas)

> **Plans for next day:** Finish free play and scene switching (this time for sure), and get started on buttons and the main menu

> **Problems/bugs noted:** I can't pass in the parent mode and scene controllers to the scenes as arguments, or else I end up getting an ImportError due to a circular import. This has the easy solution of just linking them manually after instantiation, but that is a whole other bag of worms that I'll have to explore tomorrow, to make sure it's really the right choice

> **Other notes:** I have heavily deviated from the Gantt chart, to the point where I'll consider redoing it (especially sine it didn't take much time to do in the first place). At this point I strongly doubt I'll have the time to do any sort of edit mode. In fact, since I have to juggle the research assignment, math, and any other extra ICS3U or ICS4U extra work, I'll be scrambling to even finish target mode

## TEMPLATE ENDS HERE. MEETINGS START HERE.
