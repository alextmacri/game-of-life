### Log for 2021-06-14

> **Goals for today:** Revise/finish scene functionality and cellular automata logic, and make progress on free play

> **Accomplished:** Made the revisions of the scene functionality (namely how I linked them together with parents), and fully revised the cellular automata "update" function to the point where I'm happy to implement it visually. I started that visual implementation (free play mode), but didn't get too far

> **Plans for next day:** Finish that visual implementation (free play mode), which also means making UI elements like panels and buttons (that's also most of the work for the main menu)

> **Problems/bugs noted:** same as last time (circular import for parent controller import), but this time directed at the annotation side of things

> **Other notes:** I am running extremely low on time. I get that I don't have to have this completely done, but ideally I'd really want the free and target modes done (along with the main menu obviously) because all those together resemble a full game (the map editor would be a fun gimmick, but this wouldn't exactly feel incomplete without it)

## TEMPLATE ENDS HERE. MEETINGS START HERE.
