# Steps

1. Fill in readme.md with your group's overall plans

2. Update logs/group_log.md (this is to be done each time you meet)

3. Copy logs/individual_log.md to yourname_log.md and update (to be done every day)

4. Note the folder structure (all code should be in src, all resources in assets)

5. Read over the src/sample/sample.py and run it to see a basic graphic user interface (GUI)

6. Remember the daily git workflow: pull; work; stage, commit, push
